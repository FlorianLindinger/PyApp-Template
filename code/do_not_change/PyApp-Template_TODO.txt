need admin to copy from system32?

current_file_path has \. maybe it matters. remove?

no error to log file for error in start_program?

check if all starts keep open for crash or not found

where it looks for pyron scipts for auto install. mabye get settings where they are and only check those?. but then dependancies. maybe also check in genal in code\

check no delte log if empty

===================================
settings ideas
===================================

add option to always open settings with program start

 auto open log on crash

prompt to close old opened

add option to start minimized

max crashes optoin. 

min time between crashes option

setting to make easily old terminal closing when launchging new

add option to log terminal output to log file. maybe replace python print? outside

add option to not have any prints from batch files?

check if i can add stoppping of closing terminal for non pyqt5

===================================
batch & feature ideas
===================================

Maybe add 4 normal launchers that then don't need recreation for offline sharing. Can I fix icon for that?

System tray

Implement logging features

see folder structure for placeholder files instead of coded batch

add progressbar to downlaod and install of python. mabye doable with num elems counting.->add batch function to utils

add asci character previcew of name for every batch that is not for normal start after setup. add space for unknow character? or also add äöü? add - and _ and numbers. maybe full printable ascii chars

is it possible to have pyqt5 window be same as launcher in taskbar

maybe crate install packages from file?

find option to not donwload unneded files in python install

make shortcut generator run that setup batch

detect missing packages for generate shortcuts and prompt to install.
capture missing package error and prompt install for normal run

For python reinstall. Add auto reinstall all installed packages and warn if not possible. Try first with old  packages or no reinstall. Mentioned that and possibly to use upgrade

make batch files more into utilities and add it into utilities folder

 explain behavior of reinstalling python for new version. maybe prompt for delete with text for reinstall 

#check screenshots on phone for ideas

#windows popup for crashes? maybe even in hidden terminal?

add option to copy failed install with opening tmp.txt and manually relax requirements . make pipreqs relaax auto?

make auto Make pyqt5 a scroll Menü for yaml settings with restart button

Add block of Ctrl c

option to install globally thet program

Add relativ starters aka no shortuct?

Change icon in top left corner 

Run terminal in Browser 
+ start with bookmark 

from maxi code for auto version
"""
#!/bin/bash

echo "previous version:"
cat VERSION
echo "new version:"
read version

echo "$version" > VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit -m "set version"
git push origin

git tag -a v"$version" -m "version $version"
git push origin v"$version"
"""

Let the script run in "portable" mode where all logs, configs, environments stay in a single folder -> wherever shortcut is placed also print output and let python think it is there. somehow transfer shortcut pos to batch files and python for that 

make super lightweight interface instead of terminal. maybe as option or only if installed

somehow have an option to get help when having access to shortcut
-> add info to shortcuts slots of original target?

add utilities like replace line in settings

make somehow git run generator for cloning

Change color if there's an error (e.g., red background).

color of error and so on? color of batch code?
python print color

maybe have program Name as asci art

make pyqt5 interface available and easy to use with example.

generate shrotcut to log output

confirmation question via windows popup?

auto fork option? hm maybe just actually copy via a batch file (new folder and copy (dont overwrite at all), and delete .git)
But fork allows for contributing changes back to original template. Git remplate does not but allows for own forking

make option to copy whole folder for new project somehow -> maybe a reset batch so no new download

# add coe on github from "grep-licens" that adds all licnese of python packages to folder

prompt if user wants to update git if available. Add git checks

how do i make settings not sync but also change defaults. Maybe add batch that sets settings as defautl via git. make that behaviour clear for devs -> make batch

add shortcut for log file

add back install packages batch as utility for py app with correct paths

fix 'start_program.bat' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file. when folder moved-> somehow print error

reload imports settings function? 

===================================
git ideas
===================================

make only drop in verisons that change only changd stuff and one can drop in

maybe make file comparison that updates all files one git template end to local app

batch to compare with a git link the diffs. google better ways

git batches like commit and get update

#add a mode to not sync settings. maybe local seetinfgs? like for com port

Add Syntax Checker to git and even linting?

self updatring from git option?not my code but ones that use template. like a check on Startup and asking for confirmation of update and then restart from ground
Check Git remote for updates and prompt user to pull.
 print at least if new verison available
 add a batch that update git folder. maybe only main and release. maybe propt user and disaply name and changelog(s)

===================================
readme and documentation related
===================================

explain why everything is links and why taht allows easyer updates via replace do_not_change

add descriptojn to all all shortcuts

mention that windows might ask for permissions for start since it is code from online

mayor version: remove stuff outside do_not_change
minor version: replacement or added outside do_not_change
min version: replace do_not_change enough

explain renamed needed for terminal cmd separation

add explanation for pyq5 license

fix readme for icons.

explain GitHub desktop easily?

make clear relative paths are allowid in settings and what settings are allowed fro non-user-setrtigns

 explain that you could just use poython for settings
explain all advantages/features

Add git link to readme? For base 

add to notes that you can delete after_python_crash_code.py

add readme in code\ folder   explain what everything is and that it has to keep its name

add how to copy this folder

explain that version ..x changes can be updated by replacing do_not_change and should not be breaking
v.xy changes should be breaking something
releases should always be stable
for breaking. explain what needs to be changed to fix.

fix color in python part of terminal

===================================
license related
===================================

fix license which now does not work since if user puts in restricitve license this would now be valid since he 
would restrict public code. How even icons saying cant put any license if my icons and any if theirs

make workane tempalte

is link to github in license?

make everythig but do_not_change MIT. and icons i guess
and python_env

===================================
small improvements
===================================

make all rem to REM

add error number to [Error]

replace CD wiht pushd and popd because they only change errorlevel on fail->check if better

add actiavtgion check in
python_env_activation_code_path?

and handle returned errorlevel everhywher

let AI check every file

make fail checks like: || goto :fail

add more errorlevels everywhere

make everyhwre same ehco style and code style

add more crash tests and stops everywhere 

ask AI for speedup and safety and robustness improvmens and also comments and docsttirngs

make icon cahnge exe smaller

make all global variables CAPITALIZED

replace all copy with robocopy
