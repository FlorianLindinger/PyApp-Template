can i make interactiev turn into non interactiev on reopen?

make side grouvps in vscode smaller for scolling over. or add maximize button

combine stuff from PyBoson and rest in GUI folder in utilites

in create venv batch for no rg make better print:
 [Error] "C:\Users\Flo\Documents\Repositories\PyApp-Template\code\do_not_change\general_utilities\python_environment\portable_python\python.exe" does not exist. Aborting. Press any key to exit.

make robust against pople deleting python_enviroment parent folder. does portavle batch already do that

fix portable creatos batches actually not having args path for the batches they create but default path.
Mention that paths have to be relative to work as portable. On other hand it will fail if abs input. one could want fixed pytthn and portable venv?
+ copy over changes

===================================
important
===================================

check all shortcuts and links. check if needed. also batches
check install packages form pyhton files
check new activation start
need close of setting lnk? check
check if fresh download works
test with folder path with space. especially asbs path of shortcuts
double chekc if text in non-user settings is still accurate
test portable of whole

todo reset python.txt
add placeholder batches

update git topics and order
Fix Release in git

under pyproejct toml fix license-> make everything placeholder

make shortcut generator wrok for any settings file in non-user settings path
make it not genrate shrotcut for no settings availagle. mention no settings posible

make python exe alternative for magick as gneric batch with some contorl

how to bundle imagick or only that function at least 

remove yaml related text if wriong
fix  main_code and crash code mentioning yaml and settings text

dont print installing packages if None
print that it instally python for first exectiun. maybe less spam?
maybe print ===========================
check

===================================
checks related
===================================

fix that every CD and everything resets ERRORLEVEL->check

check if works for windows not allowed long paths
and explain limits then

cehck diff of git to local with code

chekc for all file types: class custom_error_dictionary(dict):
    """dictionary subclass for custom error message of missing key"""

    def __missing__(self, key):
        raise ValueError(f'Missing-setting-error: "{key}" is not defined in {file_path}')


conside making it not temmplate

check if it allows spaces in non user args and maybe clean generally

need admin to copy from system32?

current_file_path has \. maybe it matters. remove?

allow for space paths everywhere in app name and path

function call also changes ~dp0. so deliverate use only in beginning and set as variable. avoid move to local file. rather use explicitly this varialbe. add proper globla explanation that function call does that?

test faulthandler

make make_absolute_path_if_relative work with empty path-> check all

fix warniong for following after git clone. maybe fix needed for derivative repos:
  'code/do_not_change/PyApp-Template_VERSION.txt'
  'code/do_not_change/PyApp-Template_version.txt'
  'code/do_not_change/README.txt'
  'code/do_not_change/readme.txt'
  'code/VERSION.txt'

folder generation needed somehwere?

check ground start

check portable start

cehck verson change

check all acessable linked batches

add confirmation to all folder removal?

can i have non user settings file in different drive?
generall stuff in different drives? epsecially in settings paths

install needed packages did not work for pyboson

maybe moving to local folder is not needed for setlocal?

problem if log is blocked? force replace blocked log file

no error to log file for error in start_program?

check if all starts keep open for crash or not found

where it looks for pyron scipts for auto install. mabye get settings where they are and only check those?. but then dependancies. maybe also check in genal in code\

check no delte log if empty

test lowest working python verssion

see where i get errorlevel and if it translateds to parent batch. print different message if errior

check: do i need python -m pip or not. 
do I need to update pip or python -m

check if enough print lines between spam

check install via git package possible?->add to readme if

echck install local package installs somehow via req.txt possible

test if CALL :handle_python_crash >> %log_path% 2>&1 works recuresively

check if unicode log output

test if error of batch forward for log

check: need activate env for pipreqs? for correct package version for python version?
need pipreqs to install in local? for no global python 
make somehow not add to installed packages? or exclude seomhow from being added to requriement.txt

chekc how bad and if solution needed:add some kind of detection that code crashes immediately and that it does not spam repeatedly. or some minimum delay

checl what abs PATH i need and if i dont want to run all code always

check if existance checks needed

===================================
settings ideas
===================================

 auto open log on crash

prompt to close old opened

add option to start minimized

max crashes optoin. 

min time between crashes option

setting to make easily old terminal closing when launchging new

add option to log terminal output to log file. maybe replace python print? outside

add option to not have any prints from batch files?

check if i can add stoppping of closing terminal for non pyqt5

===================================
batch related & ideas related
===================================

make a tkinter terminal instead of pyqt5 becasue no packages needed

git does not exist for donwload in git?->create batch that create git

add system tray option

make code that's runs all setup steps

Maybe add 4 normal launchers that then don't need recreation for offline sharing. Can I fix icon for that?

System tray

Implement logging features

see folder structure for placeholder files instead of coded batch

add progressbar to downlaod and install of python. mabye doable with num elems counting.->add batch function to utils

add asci character previcew of name for every batch that is not for normal start after setup. add space for unknow character? or also add äöü? add - and _ and numbers. maybe full printable ascii chars

is it possible to have pyqt5 window be same as launcher in taskbar

maybe crate install packages from file?

find option to not donwload unneded files in python install

make shortcut generator run that setup batch

capture missing package error and prompt install for normal run

For python reinstall. Add auto reinstall all installed packages and warn if not possible. Try first with old  packages or no reinstall. Mentioned that and possibly to use upgrade

make batch files more into utilities and add it into utilities folder

 explain behavior of reinstalling python for new version. maybe prompt for delete with text for reinstall 

#check screenshots on phone for ideas

#windows popup for crashes? maybe even in hidden terminal?

Run terminal in Browser 
+ start with bookmark 

from maxi code for auto version
"""
#!/bin/bash

echo "previous version:"
cat VERSION
echo "new version:"
read version

echo "$version" > VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit -m "set version"
git push origin

git tag -a v"$version" -m "version $version"
git push origin v"$version"
"""

Let the script run in "portable" mode where all logs, configs, environments stay in a single folder -> wherever shortcut is placed also print output and let python think it is there. somehow transfer shortcut pos to batch files and python for that 

make super lightweight interface instead of terminal. maybe as option or only if installed

somehow have an option to get help when having access to shortcut
-> add info to shortcuts slots of original target?

add utilities like replace line in settings

python print color

maybe have program Name as asci art

make pyqt5 interface available and easy to use with example.

generate shrotcut to log output

confirmation question via windows popup?

auto fork option? hm maybe just actually copy via a batch file (new folder and copy (dont overwrite at all), and delete .git)

make option to copy whole folder for new project somehow -> maybe a reset batch so no new download

# add coe on github from "grep-licens" that adds all licnese of python packages to folder

prompt if user wants to update git if available. Add git checks

how do i make settings not sync but also change defaults. Maybe add batch that sets settings as defautl via git. make that behaviour clear for devs -> make batch

batch to compare with a git link the diffs. google better ways

git batches like commit and get update

#add a mode to not sync settings. maybe local seetinfgs? like for com port

Add Syntax Checker to git and even linting?

self updatring from git option?not my code but ones that use template. like a check on Startup and asking for confirmation of update and then restart from ground
Check Git remote for updates and prompt user to pull.
 print at least if new verison available
 add a batch that update git folder. maybe only main and release. maybe propt user and disaply name and changelog(s)
