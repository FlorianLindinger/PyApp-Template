can i get just the packages with pipreqs. install them in emnpty venv and then freeze to get workfing list ? Yes, this is actually the most professional way to handle dependencies. It allows you to use pipreqs for discovery and pip for resolution.

make a batch for finding list of required for a given python exe and folder and output path

echo.

difference in packages is already printed by pigar

add comment to all settings: REM add a "." if otherwise backslashes are at the end  ???

ship pipreqs as folder exe?

replace pipreqs with pigar

add pipreqs mappigns to all

create a pipreqs batch that has the needed mappings for all common packages e.g. opencv-python for cv2

make a batch that find needed packages. 
save auto determined needed packges next to defualt packages


print lsit of packages whenever they are install from list
print apps that will be installed with [Info] Installing packages (see below):

how to ensure there is python for install_packages_needed_in_python_files.bat? use local python? and trigger its installatin wihtout venv?
-> apparently activaes to have ensured. maybe dont fore venv aswell. allow for only python install. definitetly becasue otherwise venv ,igjht already ahve worong installed.
definitely chekc if python vertison correct

add prints to install_packages_needed_in_python_files.bat
. maybe also what was before nad what is now and maybe diff

===================================
important
===================================

even notepad.exe for dev_tools required confirmation

is python_code_path setting working with pipreqs

make somehow shortcut generation lnk not require admin. Maybe icon is ont worth it and batch would do

add good settings for pyrefly for pyproject.toml

add placeholder batches

update git topics and order
Fix Release in git
update README

make install packages needed in python files batch seach in code and in .py scripts and not in env

  --nofollow-import-to=*.tests ^
for all

add docstrings to python to exe scripts

create license template for folder exe compiler
also chack for template

inm python compialtion batches. make input a txt file for additional nuitka args

 [Error] "C:\Users\Flo\Documents\Repositories\PyApp-Template\code\do_not_change\general_utilities\python_environment\portable_python\python.exe" does not exist. Aborting. Press any key to exit.

make robust against pople deleting python_enviroment parent folder. does portavle batch already do that

fix portable creatos batches actually not having args path for the batches they create but default path.
Mention that paths have to be relative to work as portable. On other hand it will fail if abs input. one could want fixed pytthn and portable venv?
+ copy over changes

how to deal with license for exe creators and git uploading?

make venv optional for all compilatioon scrits

test faulthandler

make make_absolute_path_if_relative work with empty path-> check all

fix warniong for following after git clone. maybe fix needed for derivative repos:

add option to start minimized

max crashes optoin. 

min time between crashes option

setting to make easily old terminal closing when launchging new

add option to log terminal output to log file. maybe replace python print? outside

add option to not have any prints from batch files?

check if i can add stoppping of closing terminal for non pyqt5

===================================
batch related & ideas related
===================================

make a tkinter terminal instead of pyqt5 becasue no packages needed

git does not exist for donwload in git?->create batch that create git

add system tray option

make code that's runs all setup steps

Maybe add 4 normal launchers that then don't need recreation for offline sharing. Can I fix icon for that?

System tray

Implement logging features

see folder structure for placeholder files instead of coded batch

add progressbar to downlaod and install of python. mabye doable with num elems counting.->add batch function to utils

add asci character previcew of name for every batch that is not for normal start after setup. add space for unknow character? or also add äöü? add - and _ and numbers. maybe full printable ascii chars

is it possible to have pyqt5 window be same as launcher in taskbar

maybe crate install packages from file?

find option to not donwload unneded files in python install

make shortcut generator run that setup batch

detect missing packages for generate shortcuts and prompt to install.
capture missing package error and prompt install for normal run

For python reinstall. Add auto reinstall all installed packages and warn if not possible. Try first with old  packages or no reinstall. Mentioned that and possibly to use upgrade

 explain behavior of reinstalling python for new version. maybe prompt for delete with text for reinstall 

#check screenshots on phone for ideas

#windows popup for crashes? maybe even in hidden terminal?

Run terminal in Browser 
+ start with bookmark 

from maxi code for auto version
"""
#!/bin/bash

echo "previous version:"
cat VERSION
echo "new version:"
read version

echo "$version" > VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit -m "set version"
git push origin

git tag -a v"$version" -m "version $version"
git push origin v"$version"
"""

Let the script run in "portable" mode where all logs, configs, environments stay in a single folder -> wherever shortcut is placed also print output and let python think it is there. somehow transfer shortcut pos to batch files and python for that 

make super lightweight interface instead of terminal. maybe as option or only if installed

somehow have an option to get help when having access to shortcut
-> add info to shortcuts slots of original target?

add utilities like replace line in settings

make somehow git run generator for cloning

Change color if there's an error (e.g., red background).

color of error and so on? color of batch code?
python print color

maybe have program Name as asci art

make pyqt5 interface available and easy to use with example.

generate shrotcut to log output

confirmation question via windows popup?

auto fork option? hm maybe just actually copy via a batch file (new folder and copy (dont overwrite at all), and delete .git)
But fork allows for contributing changes back to original template. Git remplate does not but allows for own forking

make option to copy whole folder for new project somehow -> maybe a reset batch so no new download

# add coe on github from "grep-licens" that adds all licnese of python packages to folder

prompt if user wants to update git if available. Add git checks

how do i make settings not sync but also change defaults. Maybe add batch that sets settings as defautl via git. make that behaviour clear for devs -> make batch

add shortcut for log file

add back install packages batch as utility for py app with correct paths

fix 'start_program.bat' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file. when folder moved-> somehow print error

reload imports settings function? 

===================================
git related
===================================

mabye more genera *log*.txt for gitignore.
# log files:
log.txt

make only drop in verisons that change only changd stuff and one can drop in

maybe make file comparison that updates all files one git template end to local app

batch to compare with a git link the diffs. google better ways

git batches like commit and get update

#add a mode to not sync settings. maybe local seetinfgs? like for com port

Add Syntax Checker to git and even linting?

self updatring from git option?not my code but ones that use template. like a check on Startup and asking for confirmation of update and then restart from ground
Check Git remote for updates and prompt user to pull.
 print at least if new verison available
 add a batch that update git folder. maybe only main and release. maybe propt user and disaply name and changelog(s)

===================================
readme related  and documentation related
===================================

mention 3.6+ and warn if chosen 3.5 bc wont work.


do i have to mention that "install packages needed for fiels only searches in code?


explain limitation to name: has to be allowed in names i guess. check if shortucts gernrator breaks: not allowed in names \ / : * ? " < > |

add doctrings to batches

describe in main readme quick start better that on can have differnt file edning in settings 

mention small python size option in readme

explain that Ruff settings are there and how to use. move over good ruff settings to pyprojkect

add more explanation text to gitignores

explain why everything is links and why taht allows easyer updates via replace do_not_change

add descriptojn to all all shortcuts

mention that windows might ask for permissions for start since it is code from online

mayor version: remove stuff outside do_not_change
minor version: replacement or added outside do_not_change
min version: replace do_not_change enough

explain renamed needed for terminal cmd separation

fix readme for icons.

explain GitHub desktop easily?

make clear relative paths are allowid in settings and what settings are allowed fro non-user-setrtigns

 explain that you could just use poython for settings
explain all advantages/features

Add git link to readme? For base 

add to notes that you can delete after_python_crash_code.py

add readme in code\ folder   explain what everything is and that it has to keep its name

explain that version ..x changes can be updated by replacing do_not_change and should not be breaking
v.xy changes should be breaking something
releases should always be stable
for breaking. explain what needs to be changed to fix.

fix color in python part of terminal

license related
===================================

checlk if licensing of new folder exe "generate icons" is correct


mention what the effective license allows and difference to MIT


add explanation for pyq5 license

===================================
small improvements related
===================================

print script name and path when error possible?


dont print installation if requirements.txt is empty

make it not genrate shrotcut for no settings availagle. mention no settings posible


change all to "Press enter to" for safety


dont print installing packages if None
print that it instally python for first exectiun. maybe less spam?
maybe print ===========================

make all rem to REM

add error number to [Error]

replace CD wiht pushd and popd because they only change errorlevel on fail->check if better

add actiavtgion check in
python_env_activation_code_path?

and handle returned errorlevel everhywher

let AI check every file

make fail checks like: || goto :fail

add more errorlevels everywhere

make everyhwre same ehco style and code style

add more crash tests and stops everywhere 

ask AI for speedup and safety and robustness improvmens and also comments and docsttirngs

make icon cahnge exe smaller

make all global variables CAPITALIZED
